- title: Can you put this graph on a torus? Maybe!
  abstract: "In this talk, we will explore how to embed graphs in surfaces, focusing on the connection between graph topology and surface genus. My favorite invariant from algebraic topology will appear (spoiler: it's the Euler characteristic) and we will draw some fun pictures."

- title: Funny Consequences of the Axiom of Choice
  abstract: Many of us are familiar with the Banach-Tarski paradox, but do you know of nonlinear solutions to the equation f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y), or of tricks where it seems as though we can infer an uncountably infinite amount of things from only a countably infinite amount of information? We will discuss some silly tricks you can do with the axiom of choice, and, time permitting, some of its alternatives, and the silly things you can do with them.

- title: The sequence 1, 11, 21, 1211, ... (its name is a spoiler!)
  abstract: This talk is about a very playful sequence, originally studied by John Conway, whose first terms are displayed in the title. We'll define the sequence, prove some of its basic properties, and then discuss Conway's "cosmological theorem," which determines the limiting behavior of the sequence. A surprising role is played by a particular endomorphism of the free monoid on 92 generators.
