The graduate pizza seminar is a weekly seminar run by and for graduate students
in mathematics at Penn. It is a chance for us to come together as a group, learn
a little math that one of our peers thinks is interesting enough to share, and
eat some pizza. If you are interested in giving a talk, or if you are not a math
or AMCS grad student and are interested in attending the seminar or being added
to the mailing list, feel free to contact the organizers.

We are thankful to the math department for funding our pizza budget :).

The pizza seminar is organized in 2025-26 by Chris Dunstan and Riley Shahar.
You can email both of us at [first initial][last name]@sas.upenn.edu.
